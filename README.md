# Global Suicide Rates: A Mental Health Investigation

June is Men's Mental Health Awareness Month, which serves as a crucial opportunity to shed light on these issues, fostering awareness and advocacy for improved mental health care and support systems. Mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of overall well-being. Among men, societal expectations, stigma, and limited access to resources can create barriers to seeking help, leading to disproportionately high suicide rates worldwide. 

## Overview
This project examines global suicide trends through a series of Jupyter notebooks. Using data-driven approaches, we analyze gender disparities, age-specific trends, economic influences, cultural factors, and policy impacts to better understand suicide rates, particularly in the context of Men's Mental Health Awareness Month.

## Research Questions
The study focuses on key analytical questions, including:
- How do suicide rates differ by gender across various countries?
- What age group among men has the highest suicide rates?
- Is there a correlation between economic downturns and male suicide rates?
- How does the availability of mental health services correlate with suicide rates?
- Are certain professions linked to higher male suicide risks?
- How do countries differ in reporting suicide data?
- Have policy changes successfully reduced suicide rates over time?

## Data Sources
Primary data for analysis includes:
- **[WHO Mortality Database](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/who-mortality-database)**
    * Due to large size of CSV files, raw data is accessible through the WHO website.
- **[World Bank Economic Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org)**
- **National Suicide Prevention Statistics** (country-specific datasets)

## Methodology
The analysis follows structured steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Extracting and cleaning raw suicide rate data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identifying trends and anomalies.
3. **Correlation Studies:** Examining relationships between socio-economic factors and suicide rates.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Using machine learning to assess risk factors.

## Jupyter Notebooks
The project consists of multiple notebooks, each focusing on specific aspects:
- `gender_analysis.ipynb` - Exploring gender-based suicide disparities.
- `economic_factors.ipynb` - Analyzing unemployment rates and economic downturns.
- `mental_health_access.ipynb` - Examining healthcare availability and suicide trends.
- `historical_trends.ipynb` - Investigating shifts in global suicide rates over time.
